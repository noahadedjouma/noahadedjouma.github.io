  <H1>What is a Transformers?</H1>
  Transformers are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron. Cybertron is 2,537,000 million light years from Earth or 1.4696563e+19 miles away from us. That would take about 2.5 million years to reach. People definitely won’t be seeing Cybertron for a long time.Transformers to put it simply are alien robots that can transform. Transformers can scan any object mechanical or organic even humans. Human transformers are called “Pretenders”. Transformers though prefer mechanical objects because they believe that organic beings are inferior which in a sense is kind of true.

<H2>Transformers VS Pop Culture</H2>

  Transformers can do some things that can put other pop culture characters to shame. Imagine the biggest city in the world 300x bigger and being able to transform into a giant mechanical organism. Now you have yourself a titan. Their body is way beyond the clouds being able to look into space. These things would hold Godzilla Earth (the biggest Godzilla) and crush him as if he were an ant. Optimus Prime one of the most famous Transformers ever has the power to learn the weakness of anyone he encounters and if he so pleases rewrite history with the Matrix of Leadership. Primus and Unicron are the gods of the Transformers Universe. They’re multidimensional beings who balance the dark and lightside of the universe. They can effect and watch any dimension they want. If they want to restart the DC universe they can. If they want to turn Thanos into dust, Thanos will be obliterated from reality. In fact Unicron has consumed 22.5% of all dimensions and universes IN EXISTENCE. Galactus is nothing compared to this evil behemoth.

  What is so unique about Transformers from other robots? 
  What’s also unique about Transformers from other robots is that they can do insane task on their own. Unlike Gundam a japanese robot anime, Transformers are not controlled by humans. They can do whatever they like whenever they like. Also unlike other robots like R2-D2 and Ultron transformers don’t have primitive metal armor but instead have armor impenetrable from most human weapons such as missiles and atomic bombs. Also Transformers adapting skills are unsurpassed compared to other robots. Tansformers can upgrade themselves to be able to teleport, fly, cause earthquakes, become spirits, and even run at incalcuable speeds. Transformers are truly masters at adaptaiton and evolution.

  <h2>Story</h2>

  Like other popular pop culture icons Transformers have a very intresting back story. Billions of years ago, Cybertron was a planet of peace...until the Decepticons, lusting for power, began a terrible war. Not designed for combat, the Autobots were overwhelmed and subjugated by their evil opponents. While many Autobots fled Cybertron, a few valiant survivors devised new tactics and launched a counter-offensive on their arch-foes. And thus began a terrible series of wars. Many times, both sides have claimed victory, but this has been short-lived, for the Autobots have overthrown Decepticon tyrants, and, likewise, Decepticon treachery has toppled many a peaceful Autobot ruler. And to this day, the war rages on.

    Transformers started as a toy line in 1984 and soon turned into a show the same year called "Transformers Generation 1". The show was a gigantic hit rivaling the most popular show at the time "He-man". Transformers were bought by kids, teens and especially adults. Transformers were taken off the shelves left and right and had a comic book series written by Marvel comics. Hasbro the creator of Transformers were surprised at it's success so they made a season 2 for the show which was a massive hit. Then Transformers had their first movie "Transformers the movie". It was hit and the best animated movie of it's time. Years after the show ended they created new shows and had it's own live-action movie making billions of dollars.

    As Transformers grow in popularity people demand more and more products such as movies. Transformers movies had a bad rap in the beginning due to the fact it had a terrible director. The movies story were fast paced and convoluted but what it was terrible in was the CGI and action. In this deparment they did not hold back, having one of the greatest action scenes in cinema history. The CGI in the movies are absolutely stunning making the Transformers as realsitic as possible. In the future the Transformers will be getting a new rebooted live-action series directed by the well respected Travis Knight and hopefully many more movies to come.
